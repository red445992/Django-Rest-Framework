# <h1 style="font-size: 36px;">Django Rest Framework (DRF) Learning Project</h1>


## Overview
This project is a hands-on learning journey through the Django Rest Framework (DRF). The goal is to explore and master key concepts such as building APIs, serializing Django model instances, handling requests and responses, and extending functionality to advanced features in DRF.

So far, I've learned how to:
- Create basic APIs with DRF.
- Echo data in API responses.
- Return Django model instances as API responses.
- Serialize Django model instances into dictionaries.
- Utilize the `@api_view` decorator to define API views and handle HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
- Create custom fields in serializers using `SerializerMethodField`.
- Handle model relationships and complex serialization.

## Features/Goals

### Completed Features
- **Basic API Views**: Implemented API views to handle GET and POST requests.
- **Model Serialization**: Serialized Django model instances (e.g., `Product`) to JSON format for API responses.
- **Custom Fields in Serializers**: Used `SerializerMethodField` to add computed fields to the serialized data.
- **API Responses**: Returned serialized model data as JSON responses using DRF’s `Response` object.

### Ongoing Learning Goals
- **Authentication**: Implement user authentication mechanisms such as token-based authentication and OAuth.
- **Permissions**: Learn how to define and manage API permissions to control access.
- **Advanced Serialization**: Explore deeper serialization techniques, including nested serializers and handling relationships between models (e.g., `ForeignKey`, `ManyToMany`).
- **Viewsets & Routers**: Transition to using viewsets and routers for cleaner and more reusable code.
- **Validation & Error Handling**: Implement proper validation, error handling, and custom validation in serializers.
- **Testing DRF APIs**: Learn how to test APIs using DRF’s test utilities.
- **Documentation**: Integrate tools like DRF's built-in documentation or external tools (e.g., Swagger) for automatic API documentation.
