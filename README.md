# Django Rest Framework Course Progress

## Overview

This repository contains the progress I am making while learning Django Rest Framework (DRF). The goal is to develop a strong understanding of DRF and its various components like creating API views, serializers, authentication, and working with databases using Django.

I'm following a YouTube tutorial to guide me through the learning process, and I'll update this README with my progress for each lesson.
